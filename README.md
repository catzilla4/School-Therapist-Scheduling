# School-Therapist-Scheduling
This is the School Therapist Scheduling Program.  Pretty basic name I know, but hopefully school therapists like speech language pathologists and occupational therapists can use this to help schedule their caseloads.
It features the ability to put in several constraints including: schools, therapy types, times available at a school, times the student is available, and how well students work together.
It has a dynamically generated GUI and saves all of your data to a file.
It has no dependencies, it compiles right out the box with Visual Studio 2013 or newer.
